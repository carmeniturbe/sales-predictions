# sales-predictions

Goal: Predicting and improving sales of grocery and supermarket products with different variables. Methods: Data Visualizations and Machine Learning (Decision Trees and Linear Regression)

Throughout the duration of this project, I undertook the task of data cleansing, delved into data analysis employing visualization techniques, and devised machine learning methodologies to both assess and construct predictive models for the dataset.

The culmination of the project materializes in a comprehensive slideshow presentation. This presentation effectively encapsulates the broader implications of my research, presenting a comprehensive overview of the insights derived and offering actionable recommendations for leveraging this data to bolster sales within the market. The entire content of this presentation has been thoughtfully included within this README document.

# Data Visualizations:

A heatmap exploration of our dataset has highlighted a significant correlation. Notably, there exists a moderate relationship between Item_MRP (maximum retail price) and Item_Outlet_Sales (total sales for an item at an outlet). This insight underscores the potential impact of pricing strategies on sales performance.
